                           1-Day Weather Forecast App

                  Project Description

This Python project fetches today’s weather details — including temperature, humidity, and weather condition — for any city of the user’s choice.

                     How It Works

The project uses the OpenWeatherMap API to get accurate weather data.

I imported the requests, dotenv, and os modules.

The .env file stores my API key securely.

The user is asked to enter a city name, and the program sends a request to the OpenWeatherMap API.

It returns the temperature, humidity, and weather condition for that city.

The results are displayed in a simple and easy-to-read format.

                   What I Learned

How to use environment variables (.env) to protect sensitive data.

How to convert JSON data into a Python dictionary using response.json().
